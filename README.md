# MLFlow-Project

This script trains and evaluates multiple machine learning models using **MLflow** for experiment tracking. It loads the **BankNote Authentication dataset**, performs **hyperparameter tuning** for three models (**Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM**), and logs the results in **MLflow UI** for comparison. The best-performing model can then be used for predictions. ðŸš€
